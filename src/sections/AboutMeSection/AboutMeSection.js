                        Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Drew Hatcher. I’m a full stack software engineer with nearly 2 years of experience in the industry. I greatly enjoy both frontend and backend development as they present complex problems that allow for high amounts of creativity and the ability to continuously learn in search of solutions. I attended Georgia Tech from 2017 &ndash; 2021 where I earned my Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science, while fostering my passion for teaching.
                        </p>
                        <p className="about-me-body-text">
                        Outside of my career I have a passion for the visual arts, namely photography and graphic design. I love to experience new things and capture those moments in photographs as I do. I enjoy being around and working alongside people from different walks of life, and I’m always excited to learn something new.
                        </p>
